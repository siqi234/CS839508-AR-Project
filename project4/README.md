## Project 4 Virtual Zoo: an interactive AR experience at home

Welcome to the Virtual Zoo, an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to bring the fascinating world of wildlife into your home. This project aims to create an engaging and educational experience that allows users to interact with a variety of animals right in their own living spaces. With the Virtual Zoo, you're not just observing; you're participating in a dynamic, interactive ecosystem where learning and discovery happen seamlessly as you move through your environment.

### Features:
- Interactive Animal Encounters: Explore a diverse range of animals that appear in your space. Each encounter offers a unique interaction, allowing you to observe the animals as they move and behave in a lifelike manner.
- Educational Insights: With every animal that appears, users receive informative insights detailing the species' name, natural habitat, diet, and conservation status, enriching the understanding of the animal kingdom.
- Dynamic Exploration: Animals appear one by one as you navigate your home, simulating a real zoo visit. This feature encourages physical activity and curiosity, making each step an opportunity for a new discovery.
- Customizable Experience: Users have the freedom to manage their virtual zoo environment. You can choose to remove an animal from your space and summon another, tailoring the experience to your interests.

### Technology and APIs:

This project leverages the power of Unity, a leading game development platform, combined with ARCore (for Android) and ARKit (for iOS), to create realistic and responsive AR experiences. These technologies enable the application to accurately detect physical spaces and surfaces in real time, ensuring that the animals appear naturally within the user's environment. Unity's versatile development environment supports sophisticated animations and interactions, bringing each animal to life with stunning detail and realism.

To ensure a wide range of high-quality, lifelike animal models, I utilize assets from Unity's Asset Store, supplemented by custom models designed to enhance the user experience. The application is developed with a focus on user-friendly interfaces, making it accessible and enjoyable for all ages.


### Project Goals:

My mission with the Virtual Zoo is twofold: to foster a deeper appreciation for wildlife and to educate users about the importance of conservation efforts worldwide. By bringing these experiences into homes, I aim to connect people more closely with nature, encouraging curiosity and empathy towards animals and their ecosystems.

The Virtual Zoo represents a blend of technology, education, and entertainment, showcasing the potential of AR to transform how we learn about and interact with the world around us. Whether for educational purposes, family entertainment, or individual exploration, the Virtual Zoo offers a unique window into the animal kingdom.

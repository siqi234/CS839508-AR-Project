## Project 4 Virtual Zoo: an interactive AR experience at home

Welcome to the Virtual Zoo, an immersive Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to bring the fascinating world of wildlife into your home. This project aims to create an engaging and educational experience that allows users to interact with a variety of animals right in their own living spaces. With the Virtual Zoo, you're not just observing; you're participating in a dynamic, interactive ecosystem where learning and discovery happen seamlessly as you move through your environment.

### Features:
- Random Animal Appearances: As you explore different virtual habitats (forest, ocean, safari), animals appropriate to these environments will appear randomly. This simulates a more natural and spontaneous encounter with wildlife, similar to real-world exploration.
- Interactive Animal Encounters: Interact with a variety of animals that seamlessly appear in your space. Each encounter allows you to observe lifelike movements and behaviors, providing a realistic and dynamic viewing experience.
- Educational Insights: Receive detailed information about each animal, including species name, natural habitat, diet, and conservation status. This feature enriches your understanding and appreciation of the diverse animal kingdom.
- Dynamic Exploration: The appearance of animals as you navigate through your home mimics a real zoo visit and is designed to stimulate physical activity and enhance curiosity. Each step is a chance to discover something new.

### Technology and APIs:

This project leverages the power of Unity, a leading game development platform, combined with ARCore (for Android) and ARKit (for iOS), to create realistic and responsive AR experiences. These technologies enable the application to accurately detect physical spaces and surfaces in real time, ensuring that the animals appear naturally within the user's environment. Unity's versatile development environment supports sophisticated animations and interactions, bringing each animal to life with stunning detail and realism.

To ensure a wide range of high-quality, lifelike animal models, I utilize assets from Unity's Asset Store, supplemented by custom models designed to enhance the user experience. The application is developed with a focus on user-friendly interfaces, making it accessible and enjoyable for all ages.


### Project Goals:

My mission with the Virtual Zoo is twofold: to foster a deeper appreciation for wildlife and to educate users about the importance of conservation efforts worldwide. By bringing these experiences into homes, I aim to connect people more closely with nature, encouraging curiosity and empathy towards animals and their ecosystems.

The Virtual Zoo represents a blend of technology, education, and entertainment, showcasing the potential of AR to transform how we learn about and interact with the world around us. Whether for educational purposes, family entertainment, or individual exploration, the Virtual Zoo offers a unique window into the animal kingdom.
